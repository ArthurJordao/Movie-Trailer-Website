# Project 1: Movie Trailer

This project will write a server-side code to store a list of your favorites movies including art imagery and movie trailer URL. You will then use your code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers.


## Running
1. Clone this repository or download the Zip file and UnZip it.
2. Run with [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/).
3. It will open a webpage in your browser.


## Example file

You can simply open the file fresh_tomatoes.html and see my favorites movies.
